Get Dunked
Can't touch this!
Is that the best you can do?
Lee sin could play better than you
I'll reduce yer ships to rubble, ye grog-snarfing landlubber... Arrrrgh!
You couldn't even hit the broad side of a barn!
I have calculated your chances of winning, the results are not in your favor.
Get on my level!
All your buildings are belong to me
Why don't you just give up? You're wasting my time.
Not even a blacksheepwall could make you play better.
